This makes sense because we have merge rule (32, 116) -> 256 which have appearred 15 times. \n\n**Note** \n\nIn the previous three steps, we have seen how BBPE works in slow motion. Hopefully you can see why BBPE tokenizer is a good choice for many LLMs now. Here are some questions I had prior and I want to make sure they are clear for anyone who might still have confusions:\n\n1. Why BBPE tokenizer is able to recognize all characters? Because all characters will be encoded into raw bytes using UTF-8 first. Even the tokenizer has never encoutered a character in the training set, it can still encode it with the raw bytes. The character could be represented with multiple bytes, but it can still be encoded. \n\n2. Why BBPE only have 256 vocabulary size? BBPE tokenizer has a flexible vocabulary size, but its base vocabulary size is 256 because a raw byte consists of eight bits, and there are total 2^8 possibilities of one byte. However, when the BBPE tokenizer is trained, as new merge rules created, the vocabulary size will grow. \n\n3. Why BBPE tokenizer is a more efficient choice comparing to using Unicode? As we have shown above, because of the merge rules, we can compress a combination of tokens by replacing them with one new token. So we will have a shorter token sequence to represent the same text compared to using Unicode naively. \n\nIn the next section, we will combine the steps above and train our own BBPE tokenizer.

Then, successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a new, 2-character long n-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by this new token. This is repeated until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained. Note that new words can always be constructed from final vocabulary tokens and initial-set characters.[8] All the unique tokens found in a corpus are listed in a token vocabulary, the size of which, in the case of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, is 100256. The difference between the modified and the original algorithm is that the original algorithm does not merge the most frequent pair of bytes of data, but replaces them by a new byte that was not contained in the initial dataset. A lookup table of the replacements is required to rebuild the initial dataset. The algorithm is effective for tokenization because it has low computational overhead and remains consistent and reliable.\"\ntokens = given_texts.encode('utf-8')\n# convert the binary tokens to a list of integers for each visualization\ntokens = list(map(int, tokens))\nprint(f\"the intial token size before any compression is {len(tokens)}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-11T19:35:05.957207Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-11T19:35:05.95771Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-11T19:35:05.971781Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-11T19:35:05.957652Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-11T19:35:05.970588Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"the intial token size before any compression is 1520\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# perform BBPE \ndesired_vocab_size = 280\nnum_of_merges = desired_vocab_size - 256\n# we need to create a dictionary to store all merge rule, it will be used for decoding purpose\nmerge_rule = {}\n\nfor i in range(num_of_merges):\n    pair_counts = count_pair_freq(tokens)\n    #

Let's quickly recap what we have done so far:\n\n1. In order to understand why BBPE tokenizer is a popular choice for LLMs, we have checked other types of tokenizer, such as word-level tokenizer, character-level tokenizer, or byte level using UTF-8 directly. All of those tokenizers have its own advantage, but when using in the LLMs task, they all lack some key factors. \n\n2. On the other hand, BBPE tokenizer starts with a very small base vocabulary, but also provide the flexibility to add new vocabulary by merging frequently appearred pairs. So the LLMs research can find the good balance between good size of vocabulary and good size of encoded tokens. This is the one advantage BBPE tokenizer can provide while other methods lack. \n\n3. Then, we went through the initial BPE algorithm, and the byte-level implementation steps by steps. To train a BBPE tokenizer, all training texts will be encoded into raw bytes first (normally in UTF-8). Next, we will perform BPE algorithm to find the most frequently appearred pairs to merge. We will repeat this step until we reached the desired vocabulary size. Finally, we will create final vocabulary dictionay and all merge rules. Those two things will be stored for future encode and decode tasks. \n\nIf you enjoy reading this and find it helpful, please give me a upvote.
